## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

if needed.

## the ability of modifacations

you can modify this webpage so easily and its ability to improve or be modified in the future is very good and also the code can be read easily
with comments all along the code page so you (as a programmer) can easily modify anything that you need inside the project whether its style,adding
more sections,posts or anything that you want.
